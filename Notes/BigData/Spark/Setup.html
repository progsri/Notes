Lets setup a standalone cluster manually

1. Create 3 serves ( VMs or physical machines )
   node-1 for master
   node-2 and node-3 for slaves.

2. on node-1
   a. Download spark binary  https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html
   b. run /sbin/start-master.sh
      This would open port on 8080 for Master UI and port 7077 for communication with workers processes over the newtwork.
      The 2 ports are configurable.

3. on node -2 and node-3
  a. Download spark binary  https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html
  b. run /sbin/start-slave.sh master-ip:7077
     This would open port on 8081 for the worker UI and a random port to communicate with the master process over the network.
     Port 8081 can be configured.

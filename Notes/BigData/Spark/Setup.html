Lets setup a standalone cluster manually

1. Create 3 serves ( VMs or physical machines )
   node-1 for master
   node-2 and node-3 for slaves.

2. on node-1
   a. Download spark binary
   b. run /sbin/start-master.sh
      This would open port on 8080 for Master UI and port 7077 for communication with workers.

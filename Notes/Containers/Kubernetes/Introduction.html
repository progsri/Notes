1. Master # Co ordinates the node
2. Node # These run the containerized application
3. Kubectl # a. Runs inside each node.
          b. can be used to interact with cluster using commands like below
                kubectl cluster-info
                kubectl get nodes 
                kubectl run # Deploys a image to the cluster
                kubectl get deployments # list all deployed images/application
          c. used to deployment of the application
          d. Interacts with kubernetes cluster via API..so it make HTTP calls to master.
4. Self Healing #  In Traditional world, if the application is running on 3 servers and one of the
                server goes down, you would have either  reboot that machine or spin another machine   
                and send traffic to it. Either way it is a manual process which cannot be fully automated.
                
                In  Kubernetes, the 3 instances of the application would reside in 3 different nodes/servers,
                so if one server or instance goes down, Kubernetes will automatically deploy a new container in 
                another node.
5. Pods inside the cluster can communicate with each other which means there is a private network in which these pods 
  can communicate. However services cannot see the pods inside the private network.

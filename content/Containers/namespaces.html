<h3><strong> container Namespaces </strong> </h3>
<hr>

<h4>Definition </h4>
<p>
  Namespaces lets you isolate logical resources such as pid, filesystem, network interfaces between processes. It does not
  work for physical resources such as memory, cpu and disk.
  
  <br>
  Which means 2 processes with help of namespaces can have the same pid or can use the same port.

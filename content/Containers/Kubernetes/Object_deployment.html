<h2><strong> Deployment </strong></h2>
<hr>

<p>
    Is similar to object pod but better than object pod, it can handle group of pods. It can monitor the pods and update them 
  accordingly i.e maintain replicas / desired state as mentioned . We do not use object pod in production, we use deployment.
</p>

<p>
  To create a deployment client-deployment.yaml
  <pre class="language-yaml line-numbers"><code>
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: client-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
  	matchLabels:
  	  component: web
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        component: web
    spec:
      containers:
      	-name: client
      	 image: stephengrider/multi-client
      	 ports:
      	   - containerPort: 3000
  
  </code></pre>
</p>
<p> 
    Creates 3(based on mentioned replicas) containers(pods) and assign a label web so that it can be linked to the
    networking layer via service object.
</p>
<p>
    <code> kubectl apply -f  client-deployment.yaml </code> then kubernetes will start maintaining the desired state as
    mentioned in the yaml configuration, this can be see via <code> kubectl gt deployments </code>
</p>
<p>
    Every pod created gets private ip address, to see ip <code> kubectl get pods -o wide </code>   
</p>

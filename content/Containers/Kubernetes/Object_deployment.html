<h2><strong> Deployment </strong></h2>
<hr>

<p>
    Is similar to object pod but better than object pod, it can handle group of pods. It can monitor the pods and update them 
  accordingly i.e maintain replicas / desired state as mentioned . We do not use object pod in production, we use deployment.

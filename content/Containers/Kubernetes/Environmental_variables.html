<h2><strong> Environmental variables </strong></h2>
<hr>

<p>
  We can pass environmental variables to the pod, which can be picked up as any environmental variable in regular process.
  In node to fetch env variable we do <code> process.env.KEYOFTHEVARIABLE </code>.
</p>

Here we can see how to pass environmental variable in the deployment config.
<pre class="language-yaml line-numbers"><code>
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: client-deployment
spec :
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      component: web
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        component: web
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: client
          image: slankapalli/node-hostname
          ports:
           - containerPort: 8080
          env:
            - name: NODEPORTIP
              value: client-node-port
</code></pre>

<p>
  Here we are passing environmental variable to the pods that are being created using deployment config. NODEPORTIP is the key
   client-node-port is the value. Now here as we learned that a service object gets its own ip, here we have created a service
  with name client-node-port, so if resolved client-node-port it would be resolved to the ip of the servie created with name
  client-node-port.

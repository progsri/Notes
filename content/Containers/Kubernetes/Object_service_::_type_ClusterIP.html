  <b>CLUSTER-IP</b> is the ip assigned to this service ClusterIP. Internally in the kubernetes cluster this service 
  client-ClusterIP in the above example is given the below ip  10.96.0.1. So to reach any pod that is under a ClusterIP,
  we would be using this ip.
<pre class="language-shell line-numbers"><code>
 kubectl get services -o wide

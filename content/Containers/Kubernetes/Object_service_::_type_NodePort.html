<h2><strong> object service :: NodePort </strong></h2>
<hr>

<p><b> Used only in dev.</b></p>
<p> This object is used for networking.There are different type of services:</p> 
  <ul>
    <li> Cluster Ip</li>
    <li> NodePort : used only in local and never in production </li>
    <li> Load balancer </li>  
    <li> Ingress </li>
  </ul>

<p>
  external traffic on nodePort &rarr; service on the nodePort  &rarr; find the pod by selector - label
  &rarr; targetPort of one of the container
</p>

<p>
  internal traffic on port &rarr; service on the port  &rarr; find the pod by selector - label
  &rarr; targetPort of one of the container
</p>

<h4><strong> Configuration </strong></h4>
<p>
  <li> <b> Kind </b> indicates the type of Object, it can be a service, pod , replicaController etc. </li>
  <li> <b> name </b> indicates the name of the service </li>
  <li> <b> selector </b> are key value pair that are used by other objects such as pod to relate their config to the pod.  
  </li>
  <li> <b> type </b> indicate the type of service <b> NodePort </b></li>
  <li> <b class="text-danger"> port </b> is used by other pods to communicate with this pod </li>
  <li> <b> targetPort </b> is the target port of the container </li>
  <li> <b> nodePort </b> is the port that is exposed to the public which is of the range 30000-32767, if not used kubernetes
    would assign randomly in this range. As you see if these ports are used then the client would have to explicitly mention
    them. Imagine http://google.com:31515 instead of http://google.com, this is the reason Nodeport is only used in local and
    not in production.

<p>  <b>ClusterIP</b> is the type of serivce object used by other pods to communicate with each other, it is not accessible
 from public like NodePort. It also has to be configured.
</p>
<p> This tells that pods communicate on port 3050 and that request  goes to port 31515 and that request goes to container 
port 3000 </p>
<p>
 port 3050 is not publicly exposed, would not be found via netstat as it is not a linux port and  is manged by the 
 kubernetes networking. Calls to port 3050 are forwarded to targetPort 3000.
 </p>
<p> 
port 31515 exposes the application as it is a linux port and accepting any incoming requests which get forwarded to the
containerPort.  Calls to nodePort 31515 are forwarded to targetPort 3000.
</p>
<p> This service is applied to any pod when the service <b>selector</b> key value pair matches with pod's <b>label</b>
key value pair.</p>

<p> To get detailed info about a service use <code> kubectl describe service client-node-port </code> </p>

<p> To see the listening ports in the VM on which minikube is running: <code> minikube ssh; netstat -ltn; </code>. 
  Notice we can only see <mark> 31515 </mark> and not 3050. <span class="text-danger"> Then is 3050 not the regular 
  linux port ??, which might make sense as it is not supposed to exposed to public other wise there is no way for 
  kubernetes to get control over the port.</span>

<p>
    Every pod created gets private ip address, to see ip <code> kubectl get pods -o wide </code> , if pod is terminated
    and recreated then it gets new ip address, this is exactly why we need service object so that when ever a request comes
    to the publicly exposed port via the nodePort on the service object, service would find all the matching pods with that
    match the selector key value pair of service to the label key value pair of pod and then forward the request to one of 
    the pod. <span class="text-danger"> It looks like in the background all pods when they are up they register to 
    a client discovery server that keeps the active pod, their ip address and their label information and servie simply would 
    look up this client discovery for the label it needs and gets their ip address to forward to that ip, but ip is private 
    to that node then  how does it work in a cluster ... is it possible that kubernetes makes sure that in a cluster no 2 
    nodes get the same private address and also has mapping of private adress to the node on which this pod is located.

<ol>
      <li> Master # Co ordinates the node. <span class="text-danger"> What happens when the master fails ? </span></li>
      <li> Node # These run the containerized application </li>
      <li>Kubectl #
            <ol>
                  <li>Runs inside each node.</li>
                  <li>can be used to interact with cluster using commands like below
                        kubectl cluster-info
                        kubectl get nodes
                        kubectl run # Deploys a image to the cluster
                        kubectl get deployments # list all deployed images/application</li>
                  <li>used to deployment of the application </li>
                  <li>Interacts with kubernetes cluster via API..so it make HTTP calls to master.</li>
            </ol>
      </li>
      <li> Self Healing # In Traditional world, if the application is running on 3 servers and one of the
            server goes down, you would have either reboot that machine or spin another machine
            and send traffic to it. Either way it is a manual process which cannot be fully automated.

            In Kubernetes, the 3 instances of the application would reside in 3 different nodes/servers,
            so if one server or instance goes down, Kubernetes will automatically deploy a new container in
            another node.
      </li>
      <li> Pods inside the cluster can communicate with each other which means there is a private network in which these
            pods
            can communicate. However services cannot see the pods inside the private network.
      </li>
</ol>

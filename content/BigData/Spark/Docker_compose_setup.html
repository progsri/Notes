This only works for single machine.
running multiple to containers at once

docker-compose.yml
version: '3'
services:
  master:
    image: "spark-master"
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
      - "7077:7077"
  worker:
    image: "spark-worker"

to run in foreground :: docker-compose up
to run in background or detached :: docker-compose up -d

to bring down all the container of docker-compose :: docker-compose down
What if we have 2 different docker-compose.yaml file, docker-compose down .  what does it do ????

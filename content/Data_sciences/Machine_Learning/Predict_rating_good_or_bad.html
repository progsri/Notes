Sooooo definitely your late night spot.  Hoagies found in the liquor store...I love it.  Found this place via yelp reviews, got there and to be honest the area at night was a tad bit shady, but it was well lit...the guys are friendly and the Hoagies are pretty damn good and just what you need to complete the night.  Service is quick and they have just the right selection.  My favorite is that they have cheap soda in all flavors which makes the perfect combination...and if you so desire obviously the very well stocked liquor store is there for you to find the perfect night cap while you wait for you sammie to be made.
Scotiabank theatre is an excellent place to go to sit in the dark and listen to people's semi-muted conversations.  You are guaranteed to have people talking and texting throughout your film.  I assume that this is because it is situated at douchebag ground zero where 905ers come on their weekend pass to show off their faux-hawks and tanned women. The price is pretty high too.  Plan on a couple spending $50 for tickets and a snack. So, go here to see something in IMAX, and do it Monday-Wednesday only.  On the plus side there is a bar and it is reasonably priced the area.

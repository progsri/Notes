   It is encryption technique which increase the time taken to crack the password.
 </p>  
 <p>Generally to store passwords let say in a database, we do not store them as it is, but we generate
   a hash and store that. So, when the user logins in we regenerate the hash for the user provided password and compare the
   hash with the hash in our system to authenticate. Know if the database which has these hashes is compromised, then hacker can 
   uses these hashes to find the password strings.

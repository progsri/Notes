   It is encryption technique which increase the time taken to crack the password.
 </p>  
 <p>Generally to store passwords let say in a database, we do not store them as it is, but we generate
   a hash and store that. So, when the user logins in we regenerate the hash for the user provided password and compare the
   hash with the hash in our system to authenticate. Know if the database which has these hashes is compromised, then hacker
    can uses these hashes to find the password strings. Lets see how <mark>Salt technique </mark> would make it slower to find 
    the passwrod strings.

<h4>How to get password from the compromised hashes</h4>
<h5>Rainbow tables</h5>
<p>
    Hacker maintain a list of all common passwords and their hashes, so if you have a hash and you get the password string,
   if it is a common password only.

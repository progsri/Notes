<h2><strong>Pepper</strong></h2>
<hr>

<h4>Definition</h4>
<hr>
<p>
   This is a encryption technique, where a random single character [a-zA-Z] or list of secret strings [ "an1","rqw","ewrew"]
   is concatenated to the password and the hash is generated on it and stored. 
</p>

Using pepper for generating hash
<pre class="language-bash line-numbers"><code>
password="abc123"
pepper="a"
after_concatenate=$password$salt
cmd="echo $after_concatenate | shasum"
eval $cmd .                #output 61ee8b5601a84d5154387578466c8998848ba089
</code></pre>

<p>
   At the time of user registration, the registration process will concatenate a random character let say between a to z 
   and A to Z, which means there can be 52 random characters, and then hash is generated  which is stored in the database.
   This random character <mark>pepper</mark> is not stored in the system like the <mark> salt </mark>.
   So, if the user logins in again the authentication process would have to generate 52 hashes as it does not store the <mark>
   pepper </mark> ( this would not take much time ).

<h5> Rainbow table </h5>

<p>
   The hack would not know if the pepper was used as the data that got compromised does not mention or store the pepper.
   As a result the hacker would be able to match any of the compromised hashes with the hashes in the rainbow table.
</p>
<p>
   Lets' the hacker guesses if there is a random character <mark>pepper</mark> added [a-zA-z], he would have to generate 52 hashes for
   each common password in the rainbow table which would slow the cracking process, also the system might have used a secret 
   list of strings which would be imposiible to guess unless there is insider help. At the point cracking a password is impossible.

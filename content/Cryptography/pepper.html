pepper="a"
after_concatenate=$password$salt
cmd="echo $after_concatenate | shasum"
eval $cmd .                #output 61ee8b5601a84d5154387578466c8998848ba089

   At the time of user registration, the registration process will concatenate a random character let say between a to z 
   and A to Z, which means there can be 52 random characters, and then generate the hash which is stored in the database.

   This is a encryption technique, where a random single character is concatenated to the password and the hash is generated
   on it and stored. 
</p>

Using pepper for generating hash
<pre class="language-bash line-numbers"><code>
password="abc123"
pepper="a"
after_concatenate=$password$salt
cmd="echo $after_concatenate | shasum"
eval $cmd .                #output 61ee8b5601a84d5154387578466c8998848ba089
</code></pre>

<p>
   At the time of user registration, the registration process will concatenate a random character let say between a to z 
   and A to Z, which means there can be 52 random characters, and then hash is generated  which is stored in the database.
   This random character <mark>pepper</mark> is not stored in the system like the <mark> salt </mark>.
   So, if the user logins in again the authentication process would have to generate 52 hashes as it does not store the <mark>
   pepper </mark> ( this would not take much time ).

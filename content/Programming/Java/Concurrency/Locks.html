<h2><strong> Concurrency via locks </strong></h2>

<h2><strong> With out locks </strong></h2>
<p> 
    With out any concurrency techniques the expected final value would not occur as the value of the static variable,
    which is accessible to all threads, there is fair chance that 2 threads would be seeing the same value and both 
    would increment it at the same time, this is what happens in the below example, as a result the final value is 
    1996 rather than 1999.

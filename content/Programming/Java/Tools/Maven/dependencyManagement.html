<h2><b> dependencyManagement </b></h2>
<hr>

<p>
<code> dependencyManagement </code> is used when more than one module is using the same dependency. It is always part of the 
parent. We mark all the common dependenices under dependencyManagement tag and then in the module ( child ) we will have to 
explicity mention the dependency we need under the <code> dependencies </code>.
</p>

<p>
  It helps to keep all the dependencies and the version same in all the modules. Without this each module might use a different
  version of the dependency as they can mention the version explicity.
</p>

<p>
  <code>  dependencyManagement </code> does not download the dependencies, the modules should explicity mention the dependency
  they need under <code> dependencies <code>

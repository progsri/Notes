<h2><strong>Memory allocation </strong></h2>
<hr>

<p> Below are the memory areas that the JVM uses </p>
<ul>
  <li> Heap </li>
  <li> Non Heap ( Method Area ) </li>
  <li> cache </li>
  <li> Stack </li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h4><strong> Heap </strong> </h4>
<p> All the objects are created here. </p>
<p>
    Minimum heap size can be set using -Xms and maxium heap size is set using -Xmx
</p>
<hr>


<h4><strong> Non Heap ( Method Area ) </strong> </h4>
<p> Prioir to Java 8 it is called as Permanent generation ( where size is can be varied but fixed ), In java 8 it is
called as Metaspace which dynamically grows in size.</p>

<p> <code>static</code> fields and methods are stored here </p>

<p> <code> static User user = new User() ; </code> user object is stored her with the reference to the actual object 
  but the actual object is stored in <mark> heap </mark>
</p>

<hr>


<h4><strong> Stack </strong> </h4>
<p> Temporary memory called <mark> stack frame </mark> is used per method call including constructor as it is a method call 
  as well. These stack frames are created before the method execution and then deleted after the method execution.</p>
<p>
  The code in the methods has access to local variables, <code> this </code> and <code> static fields/methods ( Non Heap ) 
  </code>, However as the stack frame are deleted, anything created locally are deleted as well. 
</p>
<p>
  Each Thread gets it own Stack.

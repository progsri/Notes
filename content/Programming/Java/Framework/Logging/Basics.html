<h4><b> Bridges </b> </h4>
<p>
These frameworks act like facade, they provide the interface which if the underlying frameworks implements then the application
would just need to implement bridge frameworks and can swap the implementors ( frameworks implementing bridges)  without code 
change.
</p>

Examples
<ul>
  <li> SLF4J </li>
  <li> Apache commons logging or Jakarta commons logging </li>
  <li> Jboss common logging </li>
</ul>

<h4> <b> Implementors </b> </h4>
<p>
  These frameworks are the actual code that do the logging. They can choose to implement the bridges or not, if they choose
  to implement the bridges like logback implements SLF4j then where ever SLF4J is used we can simply drop the logback in the
  <code> pom.xml </code> and start logging, so by implementing the well know bridges the implementors have a higher chance to
  be adopted as the pplication developers tend to use the bridges so that in the long future if the present implementor is 
  not maintained then they can look for other implementors of that bridge.
</p>

Examples
<ul>
  <li> Logback </li>
  <li> log4j2 </li>
</ul>

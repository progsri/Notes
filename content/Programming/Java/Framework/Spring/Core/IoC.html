<h4><strong> Inversion of control </strong></h4>
<p>
   Instead of the we defining explicitly the objects and their behavior, we can ask Sprin container  to create the object and
   provide us that object via the applicationContext. Spring container can provide the same object( singleton ) or different
   object( prototype ) each time we request.

<h4><strong> Dependency injection </strong></h4>
<p>
 Spring container will inject the dependency objects that are required by our class.
</p>
<p>
  Can do it either thru constructor or setter. Imagine a class C which depend on class B which internally depends on A.
   Then spring container creates A object and autowires the A object into B object by constructor or setter and then
   autowires B object into C object by constructor or setter.

<h4><strong> IoC Container </strong></h4>
<p>
   ApplicationContext represents the IoC Container. It would have all the beans( objects created by spring ) instantiated for the 
   application. Beans can be create via XML file or Java annotations.
</p>
<p>
   To be all th beans created in the IoC, we need to Inject or Autowire <code> ApplicationContext </code>, it can be autowired to any 
   class as below
   <pre><code>
   
   </code></pre>

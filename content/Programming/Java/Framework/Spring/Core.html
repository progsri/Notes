<h4><strong> Inversion of control </strong></h>
<p>
   Instead of the we defining explicitly the objects and their behavior, we can ask Sprin container  to create the object and
   provide us that object via the applicationContext. Spring container can provide the same object( singleton ) or different
   object( prototype ) each time we request.
</p>

<hr>
<h4><strong> Dependency injection </strong></h>
<p>
 Spring container will inject the dependency objects that are required by our class.
</p>
<p>
  Can do it either thru constructor or setter. Imagine a class C which depend on class B which internally depends on A.
   Then spring container creates A object and autowires the A object into B object by constructor or setter and then
   autowires B object into C object by constructor or setter.
</p>
<p>
   Each object created is called bean or spring bean or spring object.
</p>
<p>
   use ${} to read keys from properties file, you need to configure <context:property-placeholderlocation="" />
</p>

<h4><strong> Scope of beans </strong></h>
<p>
   <ul>
      <li> singleton : default same object every request </li>
      <li> prototype : new object every request </li>
      <li> request : new object for every new http request ( web only ) </li>
      <li> session : new object for every new http session (web only) </li>
      <li> global-session : <span class="text-danger"> global session </span> </li>
  </ul>

<h4><strong> Lifecycle of beans </strong></h>
<p>
   init-method for annotation based ...called when bean is created
</p>
<p>
   destroy-method for annotation based ... called when bean is destroyed
</p>

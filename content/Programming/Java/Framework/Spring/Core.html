<h4><strong> Inversion of control </strong></h2>
<p>
   Instead of the we defining explicitly the objects and their behavior, we can ask Sprin container  to create the object and
   provide us that object via the applicationContext. Spring container can provide the same object( singleton ) or different
   object( prototype ) each time we request.
</p>

<hr>
<h4><strong> Dependency injection </strong></h>
<p>
 Spring container will inject the dependency objects that are required by our class.
</p>
<p>
  Can do it either thru constructor or setter. Imagine a class C which depend on class B which internally depends on A.
   Then spring container creates A object and autowires the A object into B object by constructor or setter and then
   autowires B object into C object by constructor or setter.
</p>
<p>
   use ${} to read keys from properties file, you need to configure <context:property-placeholderlocation="" />
</p>

<hr>
<h4><strong> Scope of beans </strong></h>
<p>
   Each object created is called bean or spring bean or spring object.
</p>
<p>
   <ul>
      <li> singleton : default same object every request </li>
      <li> prototype : new object every request </li>
      <li> request : new object for every new http request ( web only ) </li>
      <li> session : new object for every new http session (web only) </li>
      <li> global-session : <span class="text-danger"> global session </span> </li>
  </ul>
<p>
   
<hr>
<h4><strong> Lifecycle of beans </strong></h>
<p>
   init-method for annotation based ...called when bean is created
</p>
<p>
   destroy-method for annotation based ... called when bean is destroyed
</p>

   
<hr>
<h4><strong> Annotations </strong></h>
<p>
   scan for packages which has the <code> @Component </code> or  <code> @Controller </code> or  <code> @Service </code> or
    <code> @Repository </code> on classes to create beans using <code> <context:component-scan base-package="" /> </code> in
   the xml configuration. This is the <b> Inversion of control </b>
</p>  
<p>
   To explicity give a bean id do @component("nameofthebean") if you do not give a bean id then spring creates one with the 
   first letter as small case. i.e Class SmartPhone with @Component is given a bean id as smartPhone.
</p>
<p>
   Classes that need a bean would mention <code> @Autowired </code> at the following places. Autowiring is the <b> dependency
   injection </b>.
   <ul>
      <li> class field : works on private field also and there is no need for constructor or setters </li>
      <li> constructor </li>
      <li> setter </li>
      <li> <span class="text-danger" > Any method </span> </li>
   </ul>
</p>
<p>
   If a class has @Autowried on it's constructor and the constructor takes a Interface type rather than the class type then
   spring would find the bean which implements that intrface and has the @Component on it, it if finds mulitple we can use
   <code> @Qualifier </code> to explicity tell which bean you want to autowire

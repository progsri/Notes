<h2><strong> Actuator </strong></h2>  
<hr>
<p> 
  To get actuator we need dependency <code> spring-boot-started-actuator </code>, just by adding this we need all the endpoints
  automatically, these endpoints start with <b> /actuator </b>
</p>

<h4><strong> Monitor the application </strong></h4>  


<hr>
<h4><strong> Health check  </strong></h4>  
<p>
  <b> /actuator/health </b> returns a json <code> {"status":"UP" }</code> which can be modified to our application.
  Let say we can make a call to DB and if we get the response then we can send a diffrent json back.
</p>

<hr>
<h4><strong> Metrics of the application </strong></h4>  
<p>
   <b> /actuator/info </b> reads the application.properties and anything that starts with info such  info.app.name or
  info.app.version would be picked up
</p>

<hr>
<h4><strong> Other </strong></h4>  
<p>
  By default only /health and /info are exposed, to expose all of them add this
  <code> management.endpoints.web.exposur.einclude=* </code> to activate all of them.
</p>

  endpoints </a>

<hr>
<h4><strong> Security for endpoints </strong></h4>  
<p>
  By default all end points are secured by spring security, We can apply spring security knowledge to use single sigon or
  Oauth for security

<h2><strong>Static behavior</strong></h2>
<hr>

<p>
   static field located in metaspace can have reference to a object in heap.
</p>

<p>
  All the staticfields and methods are stored in non heap memory called metaspace.
</p>

<p>
  At the first line of executing the code in <code> main(String[] args) </code>, all the static fields and methods are 
   executed.
</p>

<p>
   When a variable is created with static, the developer intends to store in metaspace as it would not be garbage collected,
   which means that field both primitive or reference type ( object ) would exist until manually deleted.
</p>

<h4><strong> Wrapper static variables </strong></h4>
<p>
  Wrapper static variables that declared after the static blocks are initialized before static block gets executed, the order of
  instantiation of these Wrapper static variables ( memory allocation ) happens at the time when their <code> new </code> gets 
  executed.
</p>

<h4><strong> Primitive static variables </strong></h4>
<p>
  Primitive static variables that declared after the static blocks are initialized and instantiated before static block
  gets executed with default values or with a certain value if they are declared final
 </p>

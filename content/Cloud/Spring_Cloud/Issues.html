<h4><b> ZuulException </b></h4>
<p>
  One of the way this issue occurs is when the threadpool executor used by the Zuul's ( Gateway's ) Hysterix has used up all 
  the threads. Hysterix is the one which sents out HTTP requests to the applications.By default Hysterix uses default 
  <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/wiki/Configuration">  threadpool executor configuration, which have very 
  minimum threads and no queue to store the requests after all the threads are in  active use. So When a new request comes 
  when all threads are in active usage with no queue configured to store them, all requests submitted to threadpool will
  immediately fails resulting in Gateway throwing a 500 HTTP with Zuul Exception.
</p>

<p>
  Solution for this is to configure the threadpool executor according to the application load, using parameters such as
  coreSize, maxQueueSize. 
</p>

<p>
  If <b>maxQueueSize</b> is very large, then all the applications calling other applications would be sitting in the queue 
  when all the threads are active for a longer time until the threads are free to process them, this might lead to 
  <code> feign.RetryableException: Read timed out </code> at the calling application if the feign client as lesser timeout
  value. We can increase <code> feign.client.config.default.readTimeout </code> value.

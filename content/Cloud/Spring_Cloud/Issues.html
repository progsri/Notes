<h4><b> ZuulException </b></h4>
<p>
  One of the way this issue occurs is when the threadpool executor used by the Zuul's ( Gateway's ) Hysterix has used up all 
  the threads. Hysterix is the one which sents out HTTP requests to the applications.By default Hysterix uses default 
  <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/wiki/Configuration">  threadpool executor configuration, which have very 
  minimum threads and no queue to store the requests after all the threads are in  active use. So When a new request comes 
  when all threads are in active usage with no queue configured to store them, all requests submitted to threadpool will
  immediately fails resulting in Gateway throwing a 500 HTTP with Zuul Exception.

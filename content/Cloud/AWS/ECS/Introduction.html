<h4><strong> Steps to form a cluster </strong></h4>
<p> 
Step 1:  Cluster : Create cluster by defining the number of ec2 nodes, type of instance, EBS volume, VPC, subnets, security 
    group. This would create the VM and install ecs-agent on them.
</p>
<p>
Step 2: Create a Task Definition that tells the image to use and all the other information that image(container) needs such
   as memory, ports, cpu etc.
   <pre class="language-json line-numbers"><code>
       {
      "family": "sinatra-hi",
      "containerDefinitions": [
        {
          "name": "web",
          "image": "tongueroo/sinatra:latest",
          "cpu": 128,
          "memoryReservation": 128,
          "portMappings": [
            {
              "containerPort": 4567,
              "protocol": "tcp"
            }
          ],
          "command": [
            "ruby", "hi.rb"
          ],
          "essential": true
        }
      ]
    }
    </code></pre>
</p>
<p>  
Step 3: Register the above task definition to ECS.
</p>
<p>
Step 4: Create ELB with a empty target group as ECS will map the constainer instances(not EC2 ) itself, assign a security 
group with traffic to allow the port needed. Also make sure that the EC2 cluster's security group allows traffic to the
port needed.
</p>
<p>
Step 5: Create a service with the below definition. It maps the task definition, ELB , target groups, number of instances to
run
   <pre class="language-json line-numbers"><code>
        {
            "cluster": "my-cluster",
            "serviceName": "my-service",
            "taskDefinition": "sinatra-hi",
            "loadBalancers": [
                {
                    "targetGroupArn": "FILL-IN-YOUR-TARGET-GROUP",
                    "containerName": "web",
                    "containerPort": 4567
                }
            ],
            "desiredCount": 1,
            "role": "ecsServiceRole"
        }
    </code></pre>
</p>
<p>    
Step 6 : Confirm everything is running. By verifying that the target group has the container instance. SSH to the EC2 instance
and run docker commands. Service page in the ECS UI should show the containers as healthy.
</p>
<p>
Step 7:  By curl to the DNS name of th ELB we should be able to hit our container.
</p>
<p>
If you need to need to scale up the service, just go to the UI and update the count.
</p>


<hr>
<h4><strong> Metrics and Alarms </strong></h4>
<p>
    The metrics tab on the Service page has information about the CPU and memory, which goes to the cloudwatch, we can
    then set alarms on the cloudwatch.
</p>


<hr>
<h4><strong> AutoScaling </strong></h4>
<p>
   Step1: Create launch configuarion using from the Ec2 page, this basically has information about the instane type, AMI,
    number of them needed.
</p>
<p>
  Step 2: Based on the alarm set on the metric for cpu and memory, create scaling policy to bring more EC2 instances.
<p>
<p>
   Step 3: Using the same alarm create scaling policy this time for containers on the service using the AutoScaling tab
    on the ECS serice page.
</p>
<p class="text-danger">
    lets say the alarm is triggered, at the same time EC2 and ECS is scaling then ECS would not find any readily available
    EC2 instances to deploy... Does ECS wait forever or is there a time limit.
</p>

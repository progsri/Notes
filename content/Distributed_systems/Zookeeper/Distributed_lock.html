<h2> <b> Distributed locks using Zookeeper </b> </h2>
<hr>

<p> 
  When you have mulitple services which are trying to access a common resource, having a distributed lock will be helpful so that only the service which has
  the lock will be able to access the resource while other services would be waiting to get hold of the lock.

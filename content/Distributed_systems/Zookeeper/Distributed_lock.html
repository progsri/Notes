<h2> <b> Distributed locks using Zookeeper </b> </h2>
<hr>

<p> 
  When you have mulitple services which are trying to access a common resource, having a distributed lock will be helpful so that only the service which has
  the lock will be able to access the resource while other services would be waiting to get hold of the lock. Here I will be using Zookeeper to implement a 
  distributed lock.
</p>

<p>
  We already have a Zookeeper cluster created. Please refer.
</p>
<p> 
  Let's say we have 3 services. S1, S2 and S3. Each one will try to create a <code> ephermeral znode <code>. znode is simply a zookeeper directory. 
  Ephermal indicates a temporary session, so that in case the service which create he znode dies or is having network issues, then zookeeper will detect that 
  by sending the hearbeat to the service which if the service does not respond then zookeeper would delete the znode as it is dependent on the session which is
  temporary, in this way other serices will be able to create znode.
</p>
<p>
  Create a znode is creating a <b>lock</b> as only the first service can create the znode. 
</p>
 
Imagine at this point all services are trying to create a znode ( lock ).

<h2> <b> Switch </b> </h2>
<hr>

<p>
  Switch is a physical device which has physical port to connect machine to it. Switches operate on the layer 2. It looks at 
  the ethernet frame of the packet to find out where the packet needs to go, the frame at L2 has the destination MAC address. 
  Switch will forward the packet to the port that has this destination MAC address using the MAC address table.
</p>

<h4><b> Example of L2  </b></h4>
Example of L2 (Ethernet II) inside a single network packet.... If you observe the IPV4 is L3 and TCP is the L4.

<h4><b> Mac address table  </b></h4>
<p> Switch use this Mac address table to forward the packet from one physical port to another port. </p>
<p>
    When switch receives the packet from a physical port, it will look at the source MAC address from the Ehternet frame and 
  maps it to the physical port thus creating a <code> MAC Address table </code> which has all the Source Mac Address and it's
  physical port mapping.This processs is called <code> learning </code>

<h4><b> Forwarding the packet </b></h4>
<p>
  When switch receives the packet, it would look at the destination MAC address and then using the MAC address table would 
  fetch the physical port that MAC address is mapped to. Then would send the packet to that port. This is called <code>
  forwarding </code>.
</p>
<p>
  what happens if the destination MAC address is not in the MAC address table, then the switch would have to make copies of 
  the packet and forward to all ports except the port from which it received the packet, this process is called <code> 
  flooding </code>. And not send the packet to the port it received from is called <code> filtering </code>. In the process 
  of the flooding if the packet reaches the host whose MAC address is not the destination MAC address then the host ( let 
  say Network card) would simply discard the packet. Also mostly that host would send back a ACK in case of TCP or respond
  to a ARP protocol, when it does then the switch will then learn it's MAC address and add it to it's table.

<p class="text-danger"> How does switch know where does the L2 layer start and finish OR how does it extract 
the source and destination MAC address.</p>

<h4><b> Broadcasting  </b></h4>
<p>
  When a host or a machine wants to broadcast to all the hosts in the network ( only LAN i.e all the connected hosts to
  the switch ) then it would send out a packet with destination MAC address as <code> ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff </code>. If you 
  observe the below ARP protocol the destination MAC address is ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff since the host is looking for the MAC
  address of the machine which has the IPv4

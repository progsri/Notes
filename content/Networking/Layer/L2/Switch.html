<h2> <b> Switch </b> </h2>
<hr>

<p>
  Switch is a physical device which has physical port to connect machine to it. Switches operate on the layer 2. It looks at 
  the ethernet frame of the packet to find out where the packet needs to go, the frame at L2 has the destination MAC address. 
  Switch will forward the packet to the port that has this destination MAC address using the MAC address table.
</p>

<h4><b> Example of L2  </b></h4>
Example of L2 (Ethernet II) inside a single network packet.... If you observe the IPV4 is L3 and TCP is the L4.

<h4><b> Mac address table  </b></h4>
<p> Switch use this Mac address table to forward the packet from one physical port to another port. </p>
<p>
    When switch receives the packet from a physical port, it will look at the source MAC address from the Ehternet frame and 
  maps it to the physical port thus creating a <code> MAC Address table </code> which has all the Source Mac Address and it's
  physical port mapping.This processs is called <code> learning </code>

<h4><b> Forwarding the packet </b></h4>
<p>
  When switch receives the packet, it would look at the destination MAC address and then using the MAC address table would 
  fetch the physical port that MAC address is mapped to. Then would send the packet to that port. This is called <code>
  Forwarding </code>.

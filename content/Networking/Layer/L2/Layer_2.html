<h2><b> Layer 2 </b></h2>
<hr>

<p> also called as <b> Data link layer </b> </p>
<p>
  Layer 2 receives the data from layer 1 ( ethernet cables, wifi radio signals, fiber optics ) and reassembles them based on 
  the layer 1 it is interacting with. For example if a network card is used with a ethernet cable then the ethernet cable 
  uses  <codE> IEEE 802.3 </code> protocol, based on this the Layer 2 device in this case network card knows what is the start
  and end of the frame. <code> Frame </code> is the unit used at the Layer 2 level which has all the information it received
  for one packet.
<p>
<p>
  Layer 2 deals with <code> MAC address </code>. MAC address are created by the manufacture, it stands for Media Access control
<p>
<p>
  Examples of L2 devices are switch, Network card, Router.
</p>
<p>
  The main goal of this layer is to deliver messages from one machine to another machine. These machines communicate using
  the layer 1 suchas a cable. So the intelligence lies in the layer 2 device with layer 1 just used as medium to transfer the
  data.

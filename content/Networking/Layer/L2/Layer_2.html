<h2><b> Layer 2 </b></h2>
<hr>

<p> also called as <b> Data link layer </b> </p>
<p>
  Layer 2 receives the data from layer 1 ( ethernet cables, wifi radio signals, fiber optics ) and reassembles them based on 
  the layer 1 it is interacting with. For example if a network card is used with a ethernet cable then the ethernet cable 
  uses  <codE> IEEE 802.3 </code> protocol, based on this the Layer 2 device in this case network card knows what is the start
  and end of the frame. <code> Frame </code> is the unit used at the Layer 2 level which has all the information it received
  for one packet.
<p>
<p>
  Layer 2 deals with <code> MAC address </code>. MAC address are created by the manufacture, it stands for Media Access control.
  MAC is considered as a physical address as it does not change compared to a IP address that can change for a machine.
<p>
<p>
  Examples of L2 devices are switch, Network card. Router is a L3 device.
</p>
<p>
  The main goal of this layer is to deliver messages from one machine to another machine. These machines communicate using
  the layer 1 suchas a cable. So the intelligence lies in the layer 2 device with layer 1 just used as medium to transfer the
  data.

<h4><b> Example of L3  </b></h4>
Example of L2 (Ethernet II) inside a single network packet.... If you observe the IPV4 is L3 and TCP is the L4.

  How does a machine know the MAC of the machine it needs to interact.
</p>

<p class="text-danger">
  When travelling in a network, the MAC address is removed and regenerated with the MAc of the next hop. so Layer 2 only 
  deals with the immediate hop in the end to end communication.

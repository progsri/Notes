<h2><b> Layer 1 </b> </h2>
<hr>

<p> Also known as <code> physical layer </code></p>
<p>
  The physical layer represents ethernet cable, fiber optics, bluetooth signal sender modules . All these physically transmit
  data.The data in these devices has only 2 forms <code> 1's </code> and <code> 0's </code>. The format (protocol) of the data
  comes from the sender and is reassembled by the receiver. The data signal could be electricity in case of ethernet, light in
  case of fiber optics,  radio waves in case of routers.
</p>
<p>
  In case of ethernet it use electricity i.e volatage to send each bit, so the higher voltage can be considered as 1 and lower
  voltage as 0. These higher and lower voltages are called <code> symbols </code>.
</p>
<p>
  Switches, network cards which send the data into the wire ( ehternet cables ) are not Layer 1, they are layer 2.

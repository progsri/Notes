<h2><b> UDP </b></h2>
<hr>

<p>
UDP messages must fit within a single packet (for IPv4, that means they can only hold 65,507 bytes because the 
65,535 byte packet also includes header information).

<span class="text-danger"> If the frame's payload size itself is maximum of 1472 bytes (as per my textbook), 
how can the packet size of IP be greater than that which here is 65535

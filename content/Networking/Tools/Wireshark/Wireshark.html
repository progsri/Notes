<h4><b> Wireshark's Frame </b> </h4> 
<p>
  The below image represent one network packet from the wireshark tool. The packet has 5 parts, the first part is called Frame.
  This is wireshark frame and has nothing to do with the <code> L2 Ethernet frame </code>. Looks like Wireshark adds metadata 
  of packet into this section, the actual packet on the network does not have this, so on the network there are only 4 parts of
  this packet ( just ignore the first part which is the wireshark's frame ).

<h4> <b> Request </b> </h4>
<p>
  Here I am trying to visit reactjs.org in a browser. To get the IP6 address or TYPE AAA or IPV6 address, the OS has sent DNS request for both IPV6 & IPV4 ( discussed 
  in another article ) to the dns nameserver on the network. My home internet netwrok is from xfinity so the dns nameserver is running at 75.75.75.75. In the 
  below packet if you observe the request in the Internet Protocoal 4 section we can see the <code> src </code> as my ip and <code> dst </code> as 75.75.75.75.

<h4> <b> Response </b> </h4>

<p>
  This is the response for the above DNS request. This tells that the ip addresses for reactjs.org are 104.26.9.29 / 104.26.8.29 / 172.67.70.91 .

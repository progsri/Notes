<h2><b> Physical Layer </b> </h2>
<hr>

<p>
  The physical layer represents ethernet cable, fiber optics, bluetooth signal sender modules . All these physically transmit
  data.The data in these devices has only 2 forms <code> 1's </code> and <code> 0's </code>. The format (protocol) of the data
  comes from the sender and is reassembled by the receiver. The data signal could be electricityin case of ethernet, light in
  case of fiber optics,  radio waves in case of routers.
</p>
<p>
  Switches, network cards which send the data into the wire ( ehternet cables ) are not Layer 1, they are layer 2.

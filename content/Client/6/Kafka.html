- As a producer



- AS a Consumer
  Certain system such as for sms, emails, single place content holder for mobile data give us the ability to call them using
APIs,  so that at real time we can can call them. So our clients as we are the interface between clients and these systems 
call us in real time, we have API to take their input and drop it to kafka cluster. We have topics based on the clients,
these clients sometimes need to interact with multiple system, this is reason why we have topics, if the client make a 
http call and we forward to end system in some cases multiple systems then most likely the calls will timeout .
 We have consumers to pull the messages from these systems and make the http call to the end systems andin some cases if it
errors out, we call the client api for error handling with the error andthe original message id, this way the client would 
now if there is an error.

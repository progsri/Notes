- Deployment
  a. React dist is in Nginx
  b. Nginx is configured to always send react file if it recevies any request
  c. 3 container based Spring boot servers.
  d. ALB with routing enabled .... /api goes to Spring boot target group and anything else goes to nginx container.

- Security
  1. If no token present in window.localStorage then show login page for authentication other send a authorization to Spring 
    boot server, the boot server send this token to the authentication server and verifies it, if the token is good then
    respond with {'authenticated': true} otherwise respond with {'authenticated':false} in that case react would show login
    page.
  2. Agents at the time of on boarding get credentials via  a different process, they cannot use single sign on.
  3. At login page, the agent sign in, we send the username and sha256 encrpyted password to the boot server that in turn
   sends it to authentication server, if credentials are right, react drops a token in the localStorage and shows the home   
   page.

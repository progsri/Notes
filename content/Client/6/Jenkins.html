- Pipeline has stages which has steps
- Jenkinfile is groovy file and can invoke shell.
Step 1 : Compile code using maven binary via shell
Step 2 : Run code coverage report typically using a maven plugin/goal via shell
Step 3 : Upload the coverage report to Sonal via Grovy HTTP call or using curl binary on shell
Step 4 : upload zipped code with dependencies to erota code for library scanning
Step 5 : Upload jars to S3 via aws S3 cp binary using sheel
Step 6 : Deploy Lambda code via terraform using teraaform binary
Step 7 : Add replication for s3 vis aws s3api
Step 8 : Add S3 Triggers using aws s3api
Step 9 : Run ATDD
Step 10 : Upload ATDD results

- to find out
  a. What happens if the Junit tests fails
  b. What happens if the ATDD tests fail and the code is alreay deployed in that case how do we undeploy, revert replication
 triggers.

Step 1 : There is a spring boot server that takes our request.
Step 2 : Spring boot server then talks to Kubernetes 
         via <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.16/#-strong-write-operations-deployment-v1-apps-strong-"> Kubernetes API </a>
Step 3: Kubernetes then creates teh pods we need.

We can talk to the Spring boot server via Jenkins or Lambda using http calls.


----------------
This is hypothetical.
To create Spring boot cluster.
1. Create namespace which has info on limits such as ( cpu, memory, storage, counts);
2. Inside the namespace, deploy the Deployment object which has the info about the image/container and also the selector info
   which is later used by service object for networking.
3. Inside the namespace, deploy the ClusterIP service object with the same selector as the Deployment object.
   ClusterIP object cannot be accessed externally.
4. Inside the namespace, deploy the ingress object with the path pointing to the ClusterIP service object.
5. Route external traffice to ingress.

Note: you might need a configure persiste volumes, secrets, configuration maps accordingly.
Environmental variables or configuration map can be used to send db info or redis info or specific properties.

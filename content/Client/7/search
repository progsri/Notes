- What is seriliazation, why is there no implementation of serialization interface, what is the use of SerialVerisonUID?
  seriliazation is the interface whose implementation lies insdie the JVM, it simple serializes  all the datfields, we do not
  have the choice which might not be goos sometime especially when the object is very big. To pick and choose what to 
  serialize and deserialize we need to implement Externalizable
  SerialVersionUID is used to identity the class to associate with the serialized data at the receiving side at the time of
  deserialization.

- Async - future.get() is what if the thread stops due to a exception .
    if you do not catch the exception in the Thread as the Executor service is handing the thread, the exception comes back 
    to the furture.get call, so it would not be null it would be a exception, which means Future.get should handle in the 
    try/catch block or there should be a try/catch block in the thread class itself and return a empty value indicating a 
    failure.
- Async -Difference between Future and CompletableFuture

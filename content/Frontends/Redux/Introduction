1. Create store
    you need a reducer to create a store, reducer is a function which takes 2 arguments state and action.
    
    function reducer(state, action) {
        if (typeof state === 'undefined') {
          return 0
        }

        switch (action.type) {
          case 'INCREMENT':
            return state + 1
          case 'DECREMENT':
            return state - 1
          default:
            return state
        }
      }

    var store = Redux.createStore(counter

2. Entire state is stored as a single Javascript object.
2. You can create multiple stores

3. To retrieve the present state    
    store.getState()

4. To modify the state 
    store.dispatch({<new state>}) // {<new state>}) is called action
    
    dispatch always call subcribe, so if you subscribe you store to a function, each time dispatch is called the subcribed function 
    will also be called
    store.subscribe(<function>)

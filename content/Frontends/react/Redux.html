<h2><strong> Redux </strong></h2>
<hr>

<p>
 Is use to maintain global state in the application, all the data is lost as soon as you do a browser refresh so make sure
  router handles all the routes. so if the app is opened in 2 tabs then to show the same data for say checkout items, we have
  to sync to localStorage or save to backend.
</p>

<p>
  Needs module <b> redux </b> to create redux store and <b> react-redux </b> to connect react to redux store.
 <code>const store = createStore(rootReducer) </code> rootReducer is just a function.
</p>
<p>
 Component ( stateful or stateless ) dispatches actions &#8594; Reducer updates the state &#8594;  connect updates the props 
  in the all the components that state is dependent on &#8594; as the props are updated this cause react to re render the 
  component.
</p>
<p>
   <b> Reducer </b> this is just a javascript function which gets present state and the action information. It always returns 
  a new state, it does not do the mrge like <b> setState() </b>. As a best practice aslways copy the present state and do the
  operations on the new state <b> kind o immutability </b>
</p>
  <b> connect </b> wrap the component, it takes 2 parameter , the first parameter restricts the reduc state the component can
  see and the second parameter restricts the dispatches ( actions ) it can see. Basically it will only give access to the 
  state/action that component requires. Both the state and actions are available to component via <b> props  </b>.

<pre class="language-javascript line-numbers"><code>
const mapStateToProps = state => {
    return {
        ings: state.burgerBuilder.ingredients,
        price: state.burgerBuilder.totalPrice,
        error: state.burgerBuilder.error,
        isAuthenticated: state.auth.token !== null
    };
}

const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => {
    return {
        onIngredientAdded: (ingName) => dispatch(actions.addIngredient(ingName)),
        onIngredientRemoved: (ingName) => dispatch(actions.removeIngredient(ingName)),
        onInitIngredients: () => dispatch(actions.initIngredients()),
        onInitPurchase: () => dispatch(actions.purchaseInit()),
        onSetAuthRedirectPath: (path) => dispatch(actions.setAuthRedirectPath(path))
    }
}

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(withErrorHandler( BurgerBuilder, axios ));

<p>
 <b>combine multiple reducers  </b> for easy maintainence and readability we can have multiple reducers, to combine them use
 <code> combineReducers </code> and pass in a object,  have a key for each reducer value. We will have to use this key 
 as reference in the <b>connect </b> accordingly.

 <pre class="language-javascript line-numbers"><code>
 const rootReducer = combineReducers({
    burgerBuilder: burgerBuilderReducer,
    order: orderReducer,
    auth: authReducer
});
</code> </pre>
</p>

<p>
 <b> Middleware </b> comes in between components dispatching action and the reducer.  
 Component ( stateful or stateless ) dispatches actions &#8594; Middleware &#8594;Reducer updates the state.
 It can be used to modify the state or action before sending to the reducer, generally used as a common place to do things
 such as logging.

<p>
  use <b> Redux devtools </b> by remotedevio in browser for debugging, it has excellent features including time travel.
 Use the below code to active the devtools 
<pre class="language-javascript line-numbers"><code>
 const composeEnhancers = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION_COMPOSE__ : null || compose;
const store = createStore(rootReducer, composeEnhancers(
    applyMiddleware(thunk)
)); 
 </code> </pre>

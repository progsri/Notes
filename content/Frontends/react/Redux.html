<h2><strong> Redux </strong></h2>
<hr>

<p>
 Is use to maintain gloabl state in the application, all the data is lost as soon as you do a browser refresh so make sure
  router handles all the routes. so if the app is opened in 2 tabs then to show the same data for say checkout items, we have
  to sync to localStorage or save to backend.
</p>
<p>
  Needs module <b> redux </b> to create redux store and <b> react-redux </b> to connect react to redux store.
</p>
<p>
 Component ( stateful or stateless ) dispatches actions &#8594; Reducer updates the state &#8594;  connect updates the props 
  in the all the components that state is dependent on &#8594; as the props are updated this cause react to re render the 
  component.
</p>
<p>
   <b> Reducer </b> this is just a javascript function which gets present state and the action information. It always returns 
  a new state, it does not do the mrge like <b> setState() </b>. As a best practice aslways copy the present state and do the
  operations on the new state <b> kind o immutability </b>
</p>
  <b> connect </b> wrap the component, it takes 2 parameter , the first parameter restricts the reduc state the component can
  see and the second parameter restricts the dispatches ( actions ) it can see. Basically it will only give access to the 
  state/action that component requires. Both the state and actions are available to component via <b> props  </b>.

<h2><strong> React Behavior </strong> </h2>
<hr>

<p> Based on <code> create-react-app 1_component --scripts-version 1.1.5 </code> </p>
<p>
  The html element are JSX which is nothing but javascript, which means that can be stored in as variable such a <code> 
  let p = (&lt;h2&gt;ABC&lt;/h2&gt;)</code>,observe the parenthesis. Can be used else with other JSX as <code> {p} </code>
</p>
<p>
  The custom JSX element(component) we write can export other custom /in built JSX elements such as h4 span etc.   
</p>
<p>
  Using props we can pass data from parent component to the child components as attributes. If props get update to a new 
  value only then react re-renders. It would not re-render if the updated to the existing value.
</p>
<p>
  At function level component props is local variable, so just use props.xy. At class level component props is a class field,
  so use as this.props.xy.
</p>
<p>
  using <b> props </b> we can pass data from parent to child. also we can pass parent function from parent to child, which 
  can be invoked by child to send data to parent.
</p>
<p>
  At class level we can store state locally ( this is not redux which is a global state ). The values of this state can only
  be accessed from the class ( of course as it is a class field ), if this state is used to render and the state is update to
  a new value only then react would re-render.It would not re-render if the updated to the existing value.
</p>
<p>
  When possible use stateless components which is just a function or arrow function, when using stateful component i.e class
  it becomes diffcult to manage.
</p>
<p>
  Using props we can pass functions which have access to Parent state  from parent component to the child components as
  attributes. <span class="text-danger"> But to access the Parent state we need to bind this properly ... understand

  </span>.
</p>
<p>
 event handler method receives event object
</p>
<p>
  All the css elements in .CSS files are global and these files have to be imported.
</p>
<p>
  There is no specific if else like in vue or angular. As JSX is javascript, we can use for loop or a create a new array
  with map
</p>
<p>
  Every list should have a key property that is unique for every row in this list, key is used by react to check if
  there are any chance to the list.
</p>
<p>
  For inline style pass a javascript object.
</p>
<p>
  Use <b> Radium </b> for react styling especially for pseudo selector
</p>
<p>
  Life cycle hooks to create component(only for class based components) in the order below: There are other life cycle hooks but rarely used.
  <ol>
    <li> Class constructor(props) </li>
    <li> getDerivedStateFromProps(props,state) : Very rarely used</li>
    <li> render() </li>
    <li> render() of child components</li>
    <li> componentDidMount() </li>
  </ol>
   Life cycle hooks to update component(only for class based components)  in the order below: 
  <ol>
     <li> getDreivedStateFromProps(props, state) </li>  
     <li> shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) : we can use ths.props or this.state to compare nextProps nd nextState 
          and return true or false based on which the component will update ( next steps in the cycle )   
    </li>  
     <li> render()</li>  
     <li> render of child components </li>  
     <li> getsnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState) </li>
    <li>  componentDidUpdate() </li>
  </ol>
 componentwillUnmount hook is called when the class based component is removed/destroyed/unmounted.
</p>
<p>
  We can use <b> useEffects() </b> as a way to do life cycle hooks for  functional components i.e functions which have
  components. We can have multiple useEffects in the function. useEffects is run each time that component is called or updated.
  To make it run only for specific variables that the component uses pass second argument as array with the dependent variables.
  To make it run only when the component is rendered first time pass the second argument as empty array.

<h2><strong> React Behavior </strong> </h2>
<hr>

<p> Based on <code> create-react-app 1_component --scripts-version 1.1.5 </code> </p>
<p>
  The html element are JSX which is nothing but javascript, which means that can be stored in as variable such a <code> 
  let p = (&lt;h2&gt;ABC&lt;/h2&gt;)</code>,observe the parenthesis. Can be used else with other JSX as <code> {p} </code>
</p>
<p>
  The custom JSX element(component) we write can export other custom /in built JSX elements such as h4 span etc.   
</p>
<p>
  Using props we can pass data from parent component to the child components as attributes. If props get update to a new 
  value only then react re-renders. It would not re-render if the updated to the existing value.
</p>
<p>
  At function level component props is local variable, so just use props.xy. At class level component props is a class field,
  so use as this.props.xy.
</p>
<p>
  using <b> props </b> we can pass data from parent to child. also we can pass parent function from parent to child, which 
  can be invoked by child to send data to parent.
</p>
<p>
  At class level we can store state locally ( this is not redux which is a global state ). The values of this state can only
  be accessed from the class ( of course as it is a class field ), if this state is used to render and the state is update to
  a new value only then react would re-render.It would not re-render if the updated to the existing value.
</p>
<p>
  When possible use stateless components which is just a function or arrow function, when using stateful component i.e class
  it becomes diffcult to manage.
</p>
<p>
  Using props we can pass functions which have access to Parent state  from parent component to the child components as
  attributes. <span class="text-danger"> But to access the Parent state we need to bind this properly ... understand
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this"> <u> this link </u> </a>
  </span>.
</p>
<p>
 event handler method receives event object
</p>
<p>
  All the css elements in .CSS files are global and these files have to be imported.
</p>
<p>
  There is no specific if else like in vue or angular. As JSX is javascript, we can use for loop or a create a new array
  with map
</p>
<p>
  Every list should have a key property that is unique for every row in this list, key is used by react to check if
  there are any chance to the list.
</p>
<p>
  For inline style pass a javascript object.
</p>
<p>
  Use <b> Radium </b> for react styling especially for pseudo selector
</p>
<p>
  Life cycle hooks to create component(only for class based components) in the order below: There are other life cycle hooks but rarely used.
  <ol>
    <li> Class constructor(props) </li>
    <li> getDerivedStateFromProps(props,state) : Very rarely used</li>
    <li> render() </li>
    <li> render() of child components</li>
    <li> componentDidMount() </li>
  </ol>
   Life cycle hooks to update component(only for class based components)  in the order below: 
  <ol>
     <li> getDreivedStateFromProps(props, state) </li>  
     <li> shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) : we can use ths.props or this.state to compare nextProps nd nextState 
          and return true or false based on which the component will update ( next steps in the cycle )   
    </li>  
     <li> render()</li>  
     <li> render of child components </li>  
     <li> getsnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState) </li>
    <li>  componentDidUpdate() </li>
  </ol>

<h2><strong> React Behavior </strong> </h2>
<hr>

<p> Based on <code> create-react-app 1_component --scripts-version 1.1.5 </code> </p>
<p>
  The html element are JSX, which means that can be stored in as variable such a <code>  let p = (<h2>ABC</h2>)</code>,
  observe the parenthesis. Can be used else with other JSX as <code> {p} </code>
</p>
<p>
  The custom JSX element(component) we write can export other custom /in built JSX elements such as h4 span etc.   
</p>
<p>
  Using props we can pass data from parent component to the child components as attributes. If props get update to a new 
  value only then react re-renders. It would not re-render if the updated to the existing value.
</p>
<p>
  At class level we can store state locally ( this is not redux which is a global state ). The values of this state can only
  be accessed from the class ( of course as it is a class field ), if this state is used to render and the state is update to
  a new value only then react would re-render.It would not re-render if the updated to the existing value.
</p>
<p>
  When possible use stateless components which is just a function or arrow function, when using stateful component i.e class
  it becomes diffcult to manage.
</p>
<p>
  Using props we can pass functions which have access to Parent state  from parent component to the child components as
  attributes. <span class="text-danger"> But to access the Parent state we need to bind this properly ... understand

  </span>.

<p>
 event handler receives event object
</p>
<p>
  All the css elements in .CSS files are global and these files have to be imported.
</p>
<p>
  There is no specific if else like in vue or angular. As JSX is javascript, we can use for loop or a create a new array
  with map
</p>
<p>
  Every list should have a key property that is unique for every row in this list, key is used by react to check if
  there are any chance to the list.

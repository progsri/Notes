<h2><strong> React Behavior </strong> </h2>
<hr>

<p> Based on <code> create-react-app 1_component --scripts-version 1.1.5 </code> </p>
<p>
  The html element are JSX which is nothing but javascript, which means that can be stored in as variable such a <code> 
  let p = (&lt;h2&gt;ABC&lt;/h2&gt;)</code>,observe the parenthesis. Can be used else with other JSX as <code> {p} </code>
</p>
<p>
  The custom JSX element(component) we write can export other custom /in built JSX elements such as h4 span etc.   
</p>
<p>
  Using props we can pass data from parent component to the child components as attributes. If props get update to a new 
  value only then react re-renders. It would not re-render if the updated to the existing value.
</p>
<p>
  At function level component props is local variable, so just use props.xy. At class level component props is a class field,
  so use as this.props.xy.
</p>
<p>
  using <b> props </b> we can pass data from parent to child. also we can pass parent function from parent to child, which 
  can be invoked by child to send data to parent.
</p>
<p>
  At class level we can store state locally ( this is not redux which is a global state ). The values of this state can only
  be accessed from the class ( of course as it is a class field ), if this state is used to render and the state is update to
  a new value only then react would re-render.It would not re-render if the updated to the existing value.
</p>
<p>
  When possible use stateless components which is just a function or arrow function, when using stateful component i.e class
  it becomes diffcult to manage.
</p>
<p>
  Using props we can pass functions which have access to Parent state  from parent component to the child components as
  attributes. <span class="text-danger"> But to access the Parent state we need to bind this properly ... understand
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this"> <u> this link </u> </a>
  </span>.
</p>
<p>
 event handler method receives event object
</p>
<p>
  All the css elements in .CSS files are global and these files have to be imported. To make them local, do npm run eject
  and add <b> modules and localIntentfile </b> to webpack. One you do that we can use all the classes ( .<class-names> )
  in the local css files by importing and using in the <b> className </b>. <span> if each component has local css then how
  to apply bootstrap which is a global component.</span>
</p>
<p>
  There is no specific if else like in vue or angular. As JSX is javascript, we can use for loop or a create a new array
  with map
</p>
<p>
  Every list should have a key property that is unique for every row in this list, key is used by react to check if
  there are any chance to the list.
</p>
<p>
  For inline style pass a javascript object.
</p>
<p>
  Use <b> Radium </b> for react styling especially for pseudo selector
</p>
<p>
  Life cycle hooks to create component(only for class based components) in the order below: There are other life cycle hooks but rarely used.
  <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html"> Mounting/creating a component </a>
  <ol>
    <li> Class constructor(props) </li>
    <li> getDerivedStateFromProps(props,state) : Very rarely used</li>
    <li> (legacy) componentWillMount()  : good place to update state</li>
    <li> render() </li>
    <li> render() of child components</li>
    <li> componentDidMount() :: do not update state as the component is mounted, update state would make react think 
    there are state changes and cause react to render again</li>
  </ol>
   Life cycle hooks to update component(only for class based components)  in the order below: 
    <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html"> Updating a component </a>
  <ol>
     <li> getDreivedStateFromProps(props, state) </li>  
     <li> shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) : we can use ths.props or this.state to compare nextProps nd nextState 
          and return true or false based on which the component will update ( next steps in the cycle )   
    </li>  
     <li> render()</li>  
     <li> render of child components </li>  
     <li> getsnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState) </li>
    <li>  componentDidUpdate() :: do not update state as the component is mounted, update state would make react think 
    there are state changes and cause react to render again</li>
  </ol>
 componentwillUnmount hook is called when the class based component is removed/destroyed/unmounted
    <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html"> Unmounting a component </a>.

</p>
<p>
  We can use <b> useEffects() </b> as a way to do life cycle hooks for  functional components i.e functions which have
  components. We can have multiple useEffects in the function. useEffects is run each time that component is called or updated.
  To make it run only for specific variables that the component uses pass second argument as array with the dependent variables.
  To make it run only when the component is rendered first time pass the second argument as empty array.
  <span class="text-danger"> How to use this when the component is destroyed like componentWillUnmount in case of class based component
  </span>
</p>
<p>
   npm i prop-types. With this we can set the type for props as well as mention if it is mandatory. 
</p>
<p>
  we can pass dynamic JSX as a array or array inside array representing the html div's and render it via {}. 
 </p>
 <p>
  The beauty of components very granuar component is that you can have default javascript and css for them, but if the 
   caller component want something else then they can add the specific to their css or javascript and pass that as the 
   props to the child component, if nothing is passed thenchild component will use it's own css and javascript.
   Remember that to make css local to each component use npm run eject
 </p>
<p>
  To improve performance, looks for areas where rendering ( render() ) should not happen, if there is a component which 
  renders ( for debugging just use console.log or add life cycle hook componentDidUpdate()  but you feel that should not 
  happen use life cycle hook shouldComponentUpdate() to control the behavior, this component returns true or false based on
  our validations.
</p>
<p>
  <b> PureComponent </b> is exactly same as component except that in component to know if the state and props change we would
  have to manually check in shouldComponentUpdate(), PureComponent would do a shallow check for state and props for us.
</p>
<p>
  Browser DOM is different from the DOM react uses, it is calle virtual DOM. React uses virtual DOM to compare all the changes
  that occur or needed and then only update the browser DOM with just the changes. React uses virtual DOM as operations on
  browser are slow.
</p>
<p>
  this.setState() is async.
</p>
<p>
  HOC (higher order components) are just components that can wrap other components so that they can change or add
  functionality to the wrapped components. To access wrap components use <b> props.children </b>
</p>
<p>
  use package <b> prop-types </b> to check the type (String, Integer) of the prop. we can also mandate using (isRequired).

  prop chain ...used by have to pass props from one component to the other but the middle components really do not need them.

  context API is similar to redux. <span class="text-danger"> when to use context api vs react </span>

  To make http call javascript has XmlHttpRequest, but we will be using Axios. Axios is aync ( Promise based ). To make http 
  call do it in componentWillMount(). <span class="text-danger">As componentWillMount is being deprecated... 
  what is it's replacement </span>

<h2><strong> Deployment </strong></h2>

<p>
  <code> yarn build </code> or <code> npm run build </code> creates a directoy dist which has all the files required for 
  deployment.
</p>

<p>
   Copy the dist directoy to Nginx. Since the dist has  <b> index.html </b> Nginx automatically picks it up and since index.htm
   has path to other files, when it lands at the browser, the browser will then fetch other files.
</p>

<p>
   Start Nginx and call the url.

<h2><strong> Routing </strong> </h2>
<hr>

<p>
  Not part of react, need to install module react-router and react-router-dom
</p>
<p>
  Routing is activated by element <code> BrowserRouter </code>
</p>
<p>
  Routes are configured by element <code> Route </code> which take these attributes:
   <ul><li> path : for url </li>
    <li> exact : for exact url match </li>
    <li> render : take a arrow function and renders its JSX content</li>
    <li> component : calls the component </li>
   </ul>
</p>
<p>
   To actual make the route happen, we need links which can be done via anchor tags but they cause the reload ( browser 
  spinning ) to avoid that we need to use <code> Link </code> which hash attribute <b>to </b> that can take these:
   <ul>
     <li> pathname : is the url  </li>
     <li> hash : is the html hash </li>
     <li> query : is the query string </li>
  </ul>
  Link calls Route and that calls the component which has the page content.
</p>
<p>
  When Route routes to a component it adds extra properties <b> props.match </b> to the props of the component, these 
  are not passed to the child component we have to explicity pass them to child components if they need like the regular
  props. In case if you need to pass to child components as well wrap child component with Higher order component
  <code> WithRouter</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Instead of Link if <code> NavLink </code> is used then it would work as Link and also provide css classes automatically,
  we can the add specific behavior to such classes in our local css. By default it added class='active' instead of active we
  can have our own custom class names, once we have custom classnames we can control the presentation via css.
</p>
<p>
  using <code> props.match.params.id </code> we can get the dynamic value of the path /:id 
</p>
<p>
  Order of routes in Route is important, With <code> Switch </code> component all the matching component would be applied.
  With Switch only the first matched component would be applied.
</p>
<p>
  use <code> props.location.search</code> to see the query string and <code> props.location.hash </code> to see the hash
  element.
</p>
<p>
  To programmatically go to a path o <code> props.history.push("path") </code>. All the navigation is store in th stack
  <code> props.history </code> thru which we can do back and forward operations as well.
</p>

  Nested routes
</p>
<p>
  To redirect use component <code> Redirect from="" to="" </code> or can control the Redirect component based on conditions
  or <code> props.history.push("path") </code>
</p>
<p>
  By using <code> Route component="" </code>, any url which does not have a configured path would fall here and we can use
  a component to show a Error or 404 page Not found.
</p>
<p>
  In case the basepath is http://example.com/appname instead of the regular http://example.com then do <code>
  BrowserRouter basename= "appname"</code>

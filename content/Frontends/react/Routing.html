<h2><strong> Routing </strong> </h2>

<p>
  Not part of react, need to install module react-router and react-router-dom
</p>
<p>
  Routing is activated by element <code> BrowserRoute </code>
</p>
<p>
  Routes are configured by element <code> Route </code> which take these attributes:
   <ul>
    <li> path : for url </li>
    <li> exact : for exact url match </li>
    <li> render : take a arrow function and renders its JSX content</li>
    <li> component : calls the component </li>
   </ul>
</p>
<p>
   To actual make the route happen, we need links which can be done via anchor tags but they cause the reload ( browser 
  spinning ) to avoid that we need to use <code> LINK <code> which hash attribute <b>to </b> that can take these:
   <ul>
     <li> pathname : is the url  </li>
     <li> hash : is the html hash </li>
     <li> query : is the query string </li>
  </ul>
  Link calls Route and that calls the component which has the page content.
</p>

<h2><strong> Routing </strong> </h2>
<hr>

<p>
  Not part of react, need to install module react-router and react-router-dom
</p>
<p>
  Routing is activated by element <code> BrowserRouter </code>
</p>
<p>
  Routes are configured by element <code> Route </code> which take these attributes:
   <ul>
    <li> path : for url </li>
    <li> exact : for exact url match </li>
    <li> render : take a arrow function and renders its JSX content</li>
    <li> component : calls the component </li>
   </ul>
</p>
<p>
   To actual make the route happen, we need links which can be done via anchor tags but they cause the reload ( browser 
  spinning ) to avoid that we need to use <code> Link </code> which hash attribute <b>to </b> that can take these:
   <ul>
     <li> pathname : is the url  </li>
     <li> hash : is the html hash </li>
     <li> query : is the query string </li>
  </ul>
  Link calls Route and that calls the component which has the page content.
</p>
<p>
  When Route routes to a component it adds extra properties <b> props.match </b> to the props of the component, these 
  are not passed to the child component we have to explicity pass them to child components if they need like the regular
  props. In case if you need to pass to child components as well wrap child component with Higher order component
  <code> WithRouter</code>.

1. Default, applying style in the .vue effets globally, to limit that use <code><style scoped></code>.
2. This works by the concept of shadow DOM, apart from the global DOM, new browsers have this concept of shadow DOM.
Shadow DOM simply means every element gets their own DOM, so with that we add style to only shadow dom of that element only,
naturallyonly that element gets effected.

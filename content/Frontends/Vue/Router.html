<h2><strong>Router</strong></h2>
<hr>

<p>
This does internal routing instead of going to the server for each request by default, however this behaviour can be changed 
to go to the server for every request by <code>mode: history</code>, otherwise the default would be <code>mode:hash</code>
</p>

<h4><strong>Installation</strong></h4>
<p> Router does not come by default, it has to be installed using <code>npm install vue-router</code>.

<h2><strong> Kafka concepts </strong> </h2>
<hr>

<h4><strong> Topic </strong> </h4>
<p>
 Kafka needs <b> zookeeper </b>, Zookeeper does the below. Each broker is always connected to one zookeeper. To maintain a 
 kafka cluster, we need to maintain a zookeeper cluster as well. 
 <span class="text-danger"> what else does  zookeeper do </span>
 <ul>
  <li> Leader election for the partition copy. see below</li>
</ul>

<p>
 Each topic has to be divided into mulitple partitions, each partion is stored in different kafka broker. Which means to get
 all the data for a topic, we have to go to each broker and read the topic partition.
</p>
<p>
  What happens if a broker with a partion dies, we will loose the data. In order to prevent that each partition is replicated
  to othere brokers. To do this we use <mark> replication-factor </mark>. <mark> replication-factor </mark> of 1 indicates 
  there is only one copy of the data ( so ..it is not replicated ). <mark> replication-factor </mark> of 2 indicates 2 copies
  of data, one copy is the original and other is replicated copy also call <mark> ISR In Sync Replica</mark>. Now that a partiton 
  has 2 copies only one copy should be the active/master/leader and the other one whould be ISR, this is called <b> leader election
 </b> which is perforemd by <b>zookeeper</b>
</p>
<p>
 The order of messages in each partion is maintained. Each message is given a <mark> offset </mark>, Offset is just an ID in a
 partition. As all the data of a topic can be in different partition, order of message between 2 partition is <b>not</b>
 maintained.
</p>
<p>
 All the messages are persisted for a short time. <span class="text-danger"> which can be configured ?</span> 
<p>
<p>
 Once a message is written to a topic it is <b>immutable</b>, cannot be changed/updated.
</p>
<p>
 Each message sent to a topic would end up to a different partiton based on round robin algorithm, <span class="text-danger">
 however to always force to a particular partion key has to  be used. </span>
</p>
<p>
 Group of kafka broker form a cluster. Connecting to a a single broker gives access to entire cluster. which means each broker
 is a <b>master</b> just like rabbitmq but unlike redis when using sentinel. However partitions/data are <b>master/slave</b>,
 it is master/leader and slaves where master is the orginal copy and slaves are ISR.
 <span class="text-danger"> How is the cluster formed... how does one broker know about another broker</span>
</p>

<h4><strong> Partition count </strong> </h4>
<p>
  Depends on the throughput ofthe application, if the partitons are low then consumers will be low, so if you have a high 
 throughput of writes then they will be processed slowly.
</p>

<hr>
<h4><strong> Replication factor </strong> </h4>
<p>
  Minimum is 2 and maximum is 4. The higher the replication factor the higher the work needs to be done by the broker.

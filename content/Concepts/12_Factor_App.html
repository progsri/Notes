<h4><strong> Dependencies </strong></h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    All the libraries required by the application should be packaged with the application instead of relying on a central 
    location for libraries. For example in Java we need to use <b> maven </b> to download jar to place them in <b> .m2 </b>
    central location, but we should also not depend on pulling these jar at runtime from .m2 instead we should package these
    dependent jar from .m2 into the app. Using maven also has an added advantage to fetch the dependencies quickly in case of
    new environment or new developer joining the team.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the app is dependent on system binaries such as <b> curl </b>, <b> netstat </b>, then app should not be relying on these
    binaries as new updated might remove these binaries such netstat being replaced by ss eventually. Always package these
    binaries with the application
  </li>

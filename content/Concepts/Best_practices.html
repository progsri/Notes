Controller layer
Service layer
Dao layer
Utilities as a seperate JAR, in its own repo.
Client calls ( micro services ) as a seperate JAR, in its own repo

Group them

Java
Collection ...do not return null ...return empty collections
Use Executor service with a pool when possible ( limit threads )
Use different executors for different kind of jobs. ( as they might end up in queue )
Where necessary use future calls to reduce response time.
Method Names should clearly convey
Use DB Connection pool.
Group the constants.



Microservices
Tracing :
 adding X_Request_ID as header at the web proxy

While making other HTTP calls ( micro service call ) get the X_REQUEST_ID from thread and put it in the header
repeat

   3. Make use of webhooks… if services are down Queue them






DB Connections
Use pool at Application server layer
Use JNDI at  application layer

Record all SQL, DDL in a file in your repo.
Explain plan complex queries


Servers
Always distribute your load …. While scheduling jobs ..to do this we a external tool like chronus which call API

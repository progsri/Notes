<h2><strong> Code Review </strong></h2>

<p>
  Look if @Deprecated is placed, if it is then the comment should mention what is the new method/class
</p>
<p>
  No long calls when @Transactional is used. do not make http calls when transaction is under the opened in the RDBMS , under
  large volume traffic these cause deadlocks.
</p>
<p>
  Do write continous large logic, break it into small chunks.
</p>
<p>
  when possible to boost the response time use threads or executor service.
</p>
<p>
  Use pools, connection pools for database or thread pools.
</p>
<p>
  In Java, do not return null.
</p>
<p>
  Structure of the application, if API then controller &rarr; service &rarr; dao. Keep utilites/helper classes seperate.
</p>
<p>
  Please be detailed in Git commits, will be every helpful later.
</p>
<p>
  Documentation for API, you can use swagger.
</p>
<p>
  If data does not change much, please do cache it.
</p>
<p>
  Use annotations and AOP for security, transactions, threading, caching. By having the logic inside the annotations and by 
  using the AOP concepts we can have the method for business logic only.
</p>
<p>
  Method and variable names should be explicity even if they are long.
</p>
<p>
  If using hibernate, use Lazy loading otherwise there will be a performance hit if OneToMany or ManyToMany.
</p>

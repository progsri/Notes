<h2><strong> Code Review </strong></h2>

<p>
  Look if @Deprecated is placed, if it is then the comment should mention what is the new method/class
</p>
<p>
  No long calls when @Transactional is used. do not make http calls when transaction is under the opened in the RDBMS , under
  large volume traffic these cause deadlocks.
</p>
<p>
  Do write continous large logic, break it into small chunks.
</p>
<p>
  when possible to boost the response time use threads or executor service.
